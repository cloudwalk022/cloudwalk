<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item"><p> Software as a Service (SaaS) applications are one of the most popular approaches for startups and small businesses that are looking to bring an idea to life, whether itâ€™s for businesses or consumers. Because they live in the cloud, SaaS applications are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, at any time. Rather than purchasing the application outright, SaaS users subscribe to the service. </p> <p>

Cloud Walk has helped more than two dozen startups move from their SaaS idea phase through to prototyping, developing their minimum viable product (MVP) and ultimately launching their application. We also provide post-launch support and, in some cases, have supported firms through successful IPOs.</p>
